# This is the read me for project 0x0B-more_malloc_free

the purpose of this project is to reinforce my understanding of malloc and free
functions through the completion of 4 assignments that utilize dynamic memory
allocation.

## How to use the exit function?

the exit function is used to end an entire program immediately without interpret
ing any more code.

## What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how
## to use them?

calloc is simmilar to malloc except it takes two arguments: size of mem blocks
 and number of mem blocks.  It also automatically initializes the allocated mem
to 0

realloc is used to reallocate memory that has already been allcoated dynamically
